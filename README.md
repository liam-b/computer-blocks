Computer Blocks is a tile-based electronic logic simulation tool.
It is developed by Joshua Briant and Liam Brennan, two high school students from Melbourne.
We hope this tool can eventually be put to use for both educational and recreational purposes. One way we would like to achieve this is through documenting the entire process to building a 10-bit computer.

If you would like any more information it can be accessed from our website https://www.computerblocks.com.
